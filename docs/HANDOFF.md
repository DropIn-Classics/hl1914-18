# Handoff

State of 2026-10-02: the repository was made from doskit's template.
`HL14-18.EXE` now rebuilds identically; its indirect code is not yet
fully classified.

## Start here (next session)

- AGENTS.md and PROVENANCE.md have the rules: read them first.
- `game/` holds the game's unpacked files (`doskit/tools/isox.py` for a
  CD image); it is not in the repository.

## The game's files

| Folder / file | What |
|---|---|
| `HL.EXE` | Main game program. |
| `HL14-18.EXE` | Launcher program; the port's game-file marker. |
| `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` | Intro program. |
| `EXTRO/EXTRO.EXE` | Outro program. |
| `MAP/` | Map data (`.COM`, `.FIN`, `.SHP`); the `.COM` files are data, not DOS programs. |
| `LIB/`, `TXT/`, `FX/`, `SEQ/` | Game data, text, effects and sequence data. |
| `INTRO/`, `EXTRO/`, `ZWI/` | Intro, outro and intermediate-scene data, alongside their programs. |
| Top level (`.LBM`, `.IFF`, `.PAL`, `.DAT`, `.LIB`, `.ADL`, `.SFX`) | Shared pictures, palettes, records, graphics libraries and audio data. |

The headless runner starts `HL.EXE` for two emulated seconds without an
emulation error (2026-10-02); no main-program analysis hints exist yet.

## `HL14-18.EXE` stage 1

- MZ program, entry `0000:000B`, stack `0296:0100`; its relocation
  table names 25 segment frames plus the stack frame.
- `src/HL14-18.hints` has the segment map derived from that table.
  `build.py` reaches 446 instructions and 65 labels and reports
  `IDENTICAL`.
- Eight instructions are `raw` because the current assembler cannot
  express them; their addresses are copied from `build.py` output.
- `C0015` starts one byte into its frame. Without `start=1`, later
  segments are paragraph-aligned incorrectly and the rebuilt image is
  one paragraph too long.
- The MZ header is Borland TLINK 5.0 (`linker tlink 50 header=original`)
  and its original relocation order is retained.
- A two-second deterministic runner trace loads `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` and
  reaches `C0170:0000`; that entry is recorded as a `code` hint. The
  rebuilt program remains identical (451 instructions, 66 labels).
- Not checked: the meaning and reachability of code outside that observed
  path; inspect the remaining `gaps.py` output and more runs next.

## Next

1. Finish the `HL14-18.EXE` call graph: use `gaps.py` and runs to classify
   indirect code, adding only verified pointer/table hints.
2. Stage 1 for `HL.EXE`: segments, hints, build.py and gaps.py until
   `IDENTICAL` (doskit/docs/METHOD.md).
3. Analyse `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` and `EXTRO/EXTRO.EXE` separately; transfer
   hints only when this game's own instruction streams demonstrate a
   match.
