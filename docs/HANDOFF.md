# Handoff

State of 2026-10-03: the repository was made from doskit's template.
`HL14-18.EXE` now rebuilds identically; its indirect code is not yet
fully classified.

The `doskit` submodule is now at `f4dc33c` (fast-forwarded from `95ba89e`).
The update adds `run.py -base LIN` for translating loader image addresses;
`doskit/tests/selftest.py` passed (`selftest ok`), as did this project's
`check.py` (`all ok`) and the nine synthetic tests in
`tools/test_file_formats.py`. Its earlier `xfer.py` retains a source
comment only when the hint directly below it is carried, preventing
game-specific source comments from leaking into a sibling program's carried
block. `doskit/tests/selftest.py` and this project's `check.py` passed after
the update. The runner's tested `-criterr AH ERR` option invokes a guest's
INT 24 handler for a matching INT 21 call; an `AL=3` (Fail) return becomes
`ERR` in AX with CF set. `-requirements` prints a compact end-of-run report
of the devices and VGA memory interface used, plus unknown ports and
unsupported CPU, BIOS and DOS requests; its own `REQ.EXE` test exercises
each reported category.

## Start here (next session)

- AGENTS.md and PROVENANCE.md have the rules: read them first.
- `game/` holds the game's unpacked files (`doskit/tools/isox.py` for a
  CD image); it is not in the repository.

## The game's files

| Folder / file | What |
|---|---|
| `HL.EXE` | Main game program. |
| `HL14-18.EXE` | Launcher program; the port's game-file marker. |
| `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` | Intro program. |
| `EXTRO/EXTRO.EXE` | Outro program. |
| `MAP/` | Map data (`.COM`, `.FIN`, `.SHP`); the `.COM` files are data, not DOS programs. |
| `LIB/`, `TXT/`, `FX/`, `SEQ/` | Game data, text, effects and sequence data. |
| `INTRO/`, `EXTRO/`, `ZWI/` | Intro, outro and intermediate-scene data, alongside their programs. |
| Top level (`.LBM`, `.IFF`, `.PAL`, `.DAT`, `.LIB`, `.ADL`, `.SFX`) | Shared pictures, palettes, records, graphics libraries and audio data. |

The headless runner starts `HL.EXE` for two emulated seconds without an
emulation error (2026-10-02).

## `HL.EXE` stage 1

- MZ program, entry `0000:0000`, stack `3E2E:0080`, with 146 relocation
  target frames and 5,837 relocations. Its entry explicitly loads DS with
  `3CFF`, which is the `DATA` segment.
- The program has a Borland TLINK 5.0 header and no tail after its MZ
  image. `linker tlink 50 header=original` and `relocorder original` are
  required.
- `src/HL.hints` rebuilds the program `IDENTICAL` (51,809 instructions,
  4,748 labels and 70 `raw` instructions from `build.py` output).
- A five-second deterministic run reached seven initial gaps; recursive
  descent from their recorded first instructions exposed two more reached
  gaps in the same coverage. The nine verified `code` entries rebuild
  identically as 53,218 instructions and 4,938 labels; `build.py` required
  nine additional `raw` encodings (79 total).
- Several compiler segments begin within their relocation frame. Four
  far calls cross a segment boundary; the preceding segment's `size=` and
  the following segment's `start=` preserve each relocation's original
  source frame.
- A ten-second no-input runner coverage run reached the former CODE gap at
  `CODE:114F` (71 instruction starts; first at that address). A breakpoint
  there stopped at `t=0.000231`, with `CS:IP=0076:114F`; it is recorded as
  a verified `code` entry.
- A 30-second no-input coverage run also entered the relocation-frame
  55 former-DATA relocation-frame segments. Their first observed instruction
  starts are recorded as `code` entries; the segments remain `DATA`, because
  changing their linker class moves them before DATA and changes the MZ
  image. The largest reached groups were `S167A` (2,121 instruction starts),
  `S30EF` (988), `S2F39` (612), `S27FE` (411), `S066A` (247), `S1650`
  (216), `S1571` (211) and `S2B06` (206). Three newly reached instructions
  require `raw` hints because their branch targets cannot be represented by
  the current assembler (`S0E56:0006`, `S2947:0002`, `S2BD4:0008`).
- With those entries recorded, a fresh ten-second no-input coverage run has
  34 CODE gaps (5,810 of 11,872 bytes) and reaches none of them. The former
  `114F-126C` gap is reduced to `123C-126C` (237 bytes decoded from the new
  entry). The apparent references to `CODE:123C`, `CODE:205C` and
  `CODE:2ACE` are respectively an unrelocated word, a DOS AH=09 text string
  and an argument, so they are not code-entry evidence.
- Four 20-second timed menu-key sequences (Escape/Enter, Enter/Space,
  Down/Enter and function keys) likewise reached none of those gaps. They
  changed the run state and hashes, but each coverage file still reports the
  same 34 gaps and 5,810 bytes; further menu-key variants are not a useful
  source of new code entries.
- Not checked: the classification and reachability of the remaining indirect
  CODE gaps. The non-entry relocation frames are conservatively not treated
  as code yet; use runner coverage and verified pointer/table hints next.

## `HL14-18.EXE` stage 1

- MZ program, entry `0000:000B`, stack `0296:0100`; its relocation
  table names 25 segment frames plus the stack frame.
- `src/HL14-18.hints` has the segment map derived from that table.
  `build.py` reaches 446 instructions and 65 labels and reports
  `IDENTICAL`.
- Eight instructions are `raw` because the current assembler cannot
  express them; their addresses are copied from `build.py` output.
- `C0015` starts one byte into its frame. Without `start=1`, later
  segments are paragraph-aligned incorrectly and the rebuilt image is
  one paragraph too long.
- The MZ header is Borland TLINK 5.0 (`linker tlink 50 header=original`)
  and its original relocation order is retained.
- A two-second deterministic runner trace loads `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` and
  reaches `C0170:0000`; that entry is recorded as a `code` hint. The
  rebuilt program remains identical (451 instructions, 66 labels).
- Relocated segment words following direct far CALL/JMP opcodes identify
  17 additional code entries. Adding them and the three required `raw`
  encodings expands the identical rebuild to 1,464 instructions and 191
  labels (13 `raw` instructions).
- A fresh two-second launcher coverage run again loads `INTRO/INTRO.EXE`,
  but reaches none of the remaining `gaps.py` gaps. The large `C0015`
  frame, in particular, has no verified entry yet; do not classify it from
  the code-like bytes alone.
- The three relocation sites whose values select `C0015` are segment loads,
  not direct CALL/JMP targets. `gaps.py` finds no other convincing reference
  to its only gap start. A run with Escape at five seconds exits the intro
  and starts `HL.EXE`, but reaches no launcher gap before then.
- Three DOS vector installations give verified `C0015` entries: the
  `INT 21h/AH=25h` calls at `C0015:004A`, `C0015:059A` and `C0015:0688`
  install the INT 24, INT 09 and INT 08 handlers at `C0015:055C`,
  `C0015:04F4` and `C0015:06D2`, respectively. These entries are recorded
  as `code` hints. The normal launcher path with Escape at five seconds did
  not execute the INT 24 handler before starting `HL.EXE` (zero breakpoint
  hits through 30 seconds); it also reached no C0015 gaps.
- Targeted idle, early-key and late-key launcher runs likewise gave zero
  hits at all three vector handlers and no C0015 coverage. In the late-key
  run, after `HL.EXE` loaded at `t=5.109051`, INT 08 and INT 09 pointed to
  `2B30:06D2` and `2B30:04F4`; those are offsets in `HL.EXE`, not launcher
  coverage.
- A six-second launcher input sequence (A, F1, Enter, Space, Escape, Up,
  Down and Tab) again gave zero hits at the launcher INT 09, INT 24 and INT
  08 handlers, and no C0015 gap ran. It loaded `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` at
  `t=0.000007` and, after Escape, `HL.EXE` at `t=3.111522`; by the end INT 08
  and INT 09 belonged to the loaded main program/BIOS. A two-second idle
  interrupt trace likewise showed the launcher immediately EXECing the
  intro, before its C0015 installation sites or handlers ran. The runner
  currently reports failed DOS open/EXEC operations as INT 21h error returns.
  Doskit now has the tested `-criterr AH ERR` runner option: it makes the next
  matching INT 21h call enter the guest's INT 24 vector, and an `AL=3` (Fail)
  return gives its caller `ERR` in AX with CF set. The launcher has not yet
  installed its C0015 INT 24 vector in an observed run, so this option has not
  yet produced launcher-handler coverage. These experiments add no C0015
  entries.
- Segment-boundary review (2026-10-03) found 15 tracked routines whose
  continuations had been left in the following relocation frame as data,
  including split instructions and backward branches. Explicit `size=` and
  `start=` now keep those tails with their original CS frame. The former
  `code C0170:0000` alias is covered by the continuation of `C016F:0004`
  instead. None of the extended regions contains a relocation site.
  CS-relative variables at `C00B2:0059-005A` and `C012C:0064-0069` stay
  with their routines as well; this avoids four otherwise required `raw`
  encodings caused by labels outside the segment.
  The final build reports `IDENTICAL` with 1,663 instructions, 236 labels
  and 13 `raw` instructions; no additional `raw` hints are needed.
  Fresh gap classification against both the EXEC-error coverage and the
  six-second normal coverage reports 33 gaps, 3,249 bytes, and zero reached
  gaps. The retained CS-relative variables account for two of these gaps;
  a gap is not by itself evidence of code.
- A targeted EXEC-error run (`run.py -until 1 -key 0.2 enter -criterr 4B 2
  -dos -log CODE:010C -cover build/HL14-18-collector-criterr.cover
  HL14-18.EXE`) reaches `CODE:010C` at `t=0.000010`, with AX=`007E` and
  CF set. Enter dismisses the prompt and the launcher exits with code zero
  at `t=0.200112`. The four formerly reported reached gaps are routine
  tails in the preceding frames, not new indirect entries. No DOS vector
  installation occurs before this first EXEC: the injected error uses the
  runner's default vector, so this is not evidence that `C0015:055C` ran.
- The `-criterr 4B 2` experiment above predates doskit `f4dc33c`; that
  version accepts only critical error codes 13h..1Fh. Repeating the bounded
  run with `-criterr 4B 15`, without stopping at a breakpoint, exits normally
  at `t=0.200112`: `CODE:010C` logs once at `t=0.000010` with AX=`007E`,
  while `CODE:00E9` logs zero times. Gap classification against its fresh
  coverage still reports the two CODE gaps (`0000-000B`, `00E9-00F0`) and
  three C0015 gaps (`0005-04F4`, `056C-06D2`, `0783-08F0`) as unreached.
  This valid critical-error injection adds no new launcher entry evidence.
- The same valid `ERR=15h` injection on the observed CHDIR call
  (`-criterr 3B 15`, call at CODE:0035) exits normally at `t=0.200112`.
  Breakpoints and logs at the three C0015 vector-installation sites and all
  three handlers each report zero hits; coverage again marks all three
  C0015 gaps unreached. This earlier DOS error path also gives no new entry.
- A six-second normal run with Escape at three seconds loads the intro at
  `t=0.000007`; it exits at `t=3.111517` and the launcher EXECs the main
  game at `t=3.111522`. The launcher does not reach the child-status query
  at `CODE:009A` before that run ends. Thus the later outro branch has not
  been verified by this run.
- A bounded reference audit (2026-10-03) found no decoded immediate far
  CALL/JMP or recognized relocated far pointer targeting C0015. Its three
  segment relocations are at C0015:0027, C0015:062E and C0015:0684;
  these do not establish callers of the vector-installation routines.
  The timer's indirect far call at C0015:073C addresses DATA:0E25 plus
  SI after loading DATA into DS; its table targets remain unverified.
- The CS-relative word-table loop at C00F4:00A9 advances SI twice and
  exits on a zero word. Starting at C00F4:00ED, its first zero is at
  C00F4:00F5, so the table ends at 00F7 across the next relocation frame.
  C00F4 size=F7 and C0103 start=7 retain the whole table with its reader;
  no relocation site lies in that table. A dptr records the table address
  loaded at C00F4:00A4. Another dptr records C0173:0311's DATA pointer:
  DS is loaded at 030B/030E and LES DI,[BX] consumes it at 0326.
  The rebuild remains IDENTICAL (1,663 instructions, 238 labels, 13 raw);
  gap classification against the existing six-second normal coverage still
  reports 33 gaps, 3,249 bytes, and zero reached gaps.
  These are static observations; neither table's contents or targets were
  newly verified by execution.
- Not checked: runtime reachability of the remaining launcher gaps and the
  three vector handlers under the events that invoke them; obtain targeted
  runs or identify further verified pointer/table entries next.

### Launcher size and dispatch map (2026-10-03)

- `HL14-18.EXE` is 11,872 bytes (10,848-byte MZ image). Its initial `CODE`
  segment spans only 0155h bytes and decodes to 162 instructions. The
  executable has 25 code relocation frames in total; the identical rebuild
  decodes 1,663 instructions, with DATA spanning 0E80h bytes and STACK 0100h.
  The size is distributed across linked support modules and data, not just
  the dispatcher.
- The dispatcher at CODE:000B calls C016F:0004, which uses DOS AH=4Ah to
  resize the launcher's memory block, then stores its stack and PSP. It
  changes to the INTRO directory and executes INTRO.EXE at CODE:0054. After
  return it changes to `..` and executes HL.EXE at CODE:008F. It checks the
  child's DOS return status with AH=4Dh; only AX=007Bh proceeds to the
  EXTRO directory (if its CHDIR succeeds) and executes EXTRO.EXE at
  CODE:00D5. Other statuses go to the common exit. Runs have observed the
  first two EXECs; the 007Bh branch and third EXEC have not been reached.
- The DOS failure routine at CODE:010C calls display helpers and waits for a
  key. Its two error messages and the three executable names are stored in
  DATA. Instruction evidence shows BIOS video calls in C0108/C012C, INT 33h
  mouse calls in C015D, and game-port reads at 201h in C013F. C0015 contains
  timer setup and interrupt handlers, but most of its 08F0h span remains
  unclassified; low-level I/O or helper code in other modules is not yet
  named. Keep the remaining gaps unclassified until an entry or data role is
  established.
- Static tracing of the outro condition reaches into the main game's exit
  path. HL CODE:013A calls the existing `code S066A:000D` entry and passes its
  returned AX through CODE:L034A and L02D9. When L02D9's `[BP+6]` and SI
  checks allow termination, it passes `[BP+4]` to L0159, which exits through
  DOS AH=4Ch with that byte in AL. In the decoded S066A routine, a test of
  `S331F4CA4 & 20h` conditionally stores 007Bh in its local return value;
  S063F:0198 sets that flag bit when a referenced record byte at offset 8
  has bit 0 set. The existing 30-second no-input `HL-30.cover` does not
  reach S063F:0198, S066A:46F2, or the S066A return sequence. The user
  suspects this flag/status is set on a game win, which fits the launcher's
  EXTRO condition; that meaning and an actual exit with status 007Bh are
  not runtime-verified. Do not keep probing ordinary launcher starts for
  this branch; treat the static return path as understood and the win
  trigger as unverified.

### Intro and outro first collection (2026-10-03)

- `INTRO/INTRO.EXE` is a 80,032-byte MZ file with a 5,632-byte header, 1,124
  relocations, entry `0000:0010`, and stack `1222:0080`. Its linker marker is
  consistent with TLINK 5.0. The relocation table has 68 site frames, all
  also present among the 71 target frames; `0968`, `0E07` and `0F6C` are
  target-only. `src/INTRO.hints` now records the full layout and rebuilds
  IDENTICAL: 16,176 instructions, 1,921 labels, and 47 `raw` instructions.
  Relocation overhang establishes `S094E start=5`, `S0B1B start=2` and
  `S0B1F start=3`; far pointers with target offset zero establish several
  other segment bases. DATA-class treatment of target-only frames `0E07` and
  `0F6C` remains a working classification.
- A deterministic two-second runner session loaded INTRO at PSP `0077`,
  completed 12,000,001 instructions over 80 frames without an emulation error,
  and opened `INTRO.ADL`, `BANG.ANI`, `BANG.PAL`, `BANG.TXT`, `CHR14.LIB`, and
  `BANG.SFX`. Coverage marked 28 gaps reached; their first instruction
  addresses are now `code` hints. CODE and several relocation frames still
  have unclassified gaps; the two-second run does not settle all code/data
  roles.
- `EXTRO/EXTRO.EXE` is a 75,136-byte MZ file with a 5,120-byte header, 1,042
  relocations, entry `0000:0010`, and stack `1110:0080`. Its temporary
  segment map is now in `src/EXTRO.hints` and rebuilds `IDENTICAL`: 14,715
  instructions, 1,870 labels and, after explicit raw hints, 57 `raw`
  instructions. Site extents establish `S04AD start=3`, `S0592 start=B` and
  `S068A start=6`; the rebuilt stack is again `1110:0080` and the relocation
  sets and order match. Frames `0D22` and `0E5B` remain CODE-class because
  their roles have not been established.
- A normal EXTRO runner session exits with code 0 after 2,370 instructions.
  With the exact launcher tail, a 30-second run reached 180,000,001
  instructions and marked its runtime-seeded gaps. Remaining code-class
  gaps total 5,367 bytes and none ran in that coverage session. A clean
  `xfer.py` alignment from INTRO mapped 15,395 of 23,576 / 27,996
  instructions, 141 data addresses and 37 segments; 55 code/raw hints
  transferred and 20 did not map. This is partial instruction-stream
  similarity, not whole-program identity.
- Commands and files used for this collection are local: generated sources,
  rebuilds and coverage are under ignored `build/`; the temporary EXTRO
  hints are outside the repository. No game bytes were added.

### EXTRO command-tail launch probe (2026-10-03)

- The launcher's EXTRO EXEC uses `BX=0008`, `DX=002F` and a parameter block
  whose command-tail pointer is `CS:0000`. The launcher image encodes a
  nine-character DOS command tail there. A direct EXTRO run with that same
  tail took the long path: it opened/read
  `EXTRO1.ADL`, `EISENBAH.LBM`, `EISEN0.PAL`, `EISENBAH.PAL`, `EISEN2.PAL` and
  `warend.txt`, then remained active until `-until 40` (240,000,001 total
  runner instructions). Direct runs without a tail exited after 2,370
  instructions; `/?` also exited early. Passing the matching tail as one
  argument or as two arguments produced identical open timing and coverage.
- A launcher run that skipped HL.EXE but retained the launcher-created
  EXTRO EXEC context also ran through the 30-second limit and opened the same
  assets. Thus HL execution and its persistent file state are not required
  for this behavior. Runs stopped at the time limit, so EXTRO's natural end
  was not observed. The matching command tail explains the immediate direct
  exit; which characters EXTRO checks has not yet been isolated.
- The exact launcher tail is required for the observed long path: a direct
  run with only its leading `0` or with a different identifier exits early
  (2,509 and 2,721 instructions respectively) without attempting file
  opens. The identity-specific check has not been located in the disassembly.
- EXTRO reads and tokenizes the child PSP command tail in an indirect path
  decoded at raw image offsets `1DC5`–`1ED0`. These are image offsets under
  the current segment map, not yet stable named-segment addresses. The exact
  tail and a mismatched identifier both reach the argument dispatcher; their
  execution diverges after its indirect dispatch. The specific comparison
  and branch have not yet been assigned a verified EXTRO code address.
- All probe logs and coverage are in ignored `build/extro-probe/`. The DOS
  trace is very large because EXTRO polls DOS during its active loop; avoid
  long `-dos` runs when coverage or targeted breakpoints are sufficient.

## Next

1. For `HL14-18.EXE`, keep the remaining C0015 gaps and vector handlers
   unclassified until an incoming call or table target is evidenced. Do not
   repeat ordinary launcher runs for these gaps. The dispatcher and
   conditional EXTRO path are statically mapped; the likely win trigger for
   status 007Bh remains unverified.
2. Classify `HL.EXE` indirect code with `gaps.py`, runner coverage and
   verified pointer/table hints, then begin stage 2 names and records.
3. Finish `EXTRO/EXTRO.EXE` stage 1: establish its segment boundaries and
   classification until its rebuild is IDENTICAL. Then analyse its reached
   gaps using the exact launcher command tail. Transfer INTRO hints only
   where this game's own instruction streams demonstrate a match.

## bisle file-tool compatibility probe (2026-10-03)

At the user's request, the unchanged file-tool CLIs from sibling `bisle`
revision `a88573b7cef03de0521d65518a0a307a6fb45359` were run as black boxes
on this project's installed History Line data. Their implementation source
was not read or copied. This is a tool-compatibility experiment, not evidence
for History Line's runtime interpretation and not permission to derive
History Line code from Battle Isle's game-specific parsers.

Results from explicit input paths (success means the tool reported
`written back identical`, rather than merely exiting with status zero):

| Tool | Result on History Line files |
|---|---|
| `tpwmfiles.py` | All 489 packed files found in a 544-file recursive scan round-trip identically; zero failures. |
| `ifffiles.py` | All 66 recursively found `.IFF` / `.LBM` files round-trip identically. |
| `palfiles.py` | All 33 `.PAL` files round-trip identically. |
| `libfiles.py` | All 21 `.LIB` files round-trip identically. `NEWCHAR6.LIB` needs UTF-8 stdout on this Windows host; the first failure was an output-encoding error. |
| `txtfiles.py` | `CHAR6.DAT` and `TITEL.TXT` round-trip identically; `GAME.TXT` is rejected with `text 0 does not end`. Other text layouts are unverified. |
| `datfiles.py` | Top-level `CODES.DAT` and `AMOK.DAT`, and `LIB/UNIT.DAT`, round-trip identically. Top-level `UNIT.DAT` is rejected with `3519 bytes, not records of 68`; `LIB/GROUND.DAT` with `271792 bytes, not records of 6`. The original top-level directory also lacks the expected `GROUND.DAT`. |
| `mapfiles.py` | Direct use on `game/MAP` stops at the missing top-level `GROUND.DAT`. With the actual `LIB/GROUND.DAT` and `LIB/UNIT.DAT` copied unchanged into a temporary root beside a copy of `MAP`, 73 maps are tested: `STATMAP` round-trips identically, while all 72 numbered maps fail on trailing `.SHP` data (36 to 228 bytes after the recognized records). No alternative ground file was substituted. |
| `sndfiles.py` | Directory invocation finds zero files: exit zero is vacuous, and sound compatibility is unverified. |

PNG export also succeeds for `AHHIMMEL.LBM` (one image), `00.PAL`
(one image), and `INTRO/CHR14.LIB` with explicit `--pal game/00.PAL`
(47 images); these exports were not visually or semantically verified.

Reproduction: pass each file recognized as packed to
`python ../bisle/tools/tpwmfiles.py FILE`; run
`python ../bisle/tools/ifffiles.py FILE` (likewise
`palfiles.py` and `libfiles.py`) for every matching file recursively under
`game/`; run `txtfiles.py game`, `datfiles.py game`, `datfiles.py game/LIB`,
`sndfiles.py game`, and `mapfiles.py game/MAP`. Set
`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` for the Windows console. For the additional map
experiment, place unchanged copies of `game/LIB/GROUND.DAT`,
`game/LIB/UNIT.DAT`, and `game/MAP/` under
`build/file-tools-probe/staged-game/`, then pass that root's `MAP` directory.
The local command logs and input/exit metadata are in
`build/file-tools-probe/`; no game bytes or generated assets are tracked.

Not verified: writer internals (whether any fields pass through unchanged),
rendered-image correctness, audio playback, interpretation of map suffixes,
and any of these formats against History Line's original loading routines.
The successful tools can help inspect local assets immediately; a port
parser still needs independent evidence from History Line itself. Prioritize
its `.SHP` reader and the distinct table/text layouts rather than assuming
all corresponding Battle Isle formats match.

### Adoption requested after the probe

The user then explicitly requested adopting the working tools. The four
fully successful tool families (`tpwmfiles.py`, `palfiles.py`,
`ifffiles.py`, `libfiles.py`) and their `png.py` dependency now live under
`tools/`. `PROVENANCE.md` records this scoped exception and source revision;
these are imported offline analysis tools, not independent History Line
implementations or runtime code. No partial table/text tools or unverified
sound/map tools were included in that initial adoption.

Library PNG output now defaults to the game's top-level `00.PAL` and
colour base zero; Battle Isle's library-specific colour bases were removed.
Descriptions no longer present Battle Isle executable observations as
History Line evidence. Parsing/packing is otherwise retained. Source
inspection confirms that unknown library entries, entry tails and unknown
IFF chunks can pass through unchanged; successful round trips therefore
prove less than complete format reconstruction. See `tools/README.md` for
directory checks and local export commands.

The first imported picture tool's directory scan also selected 12
`FX/*.SFX` IFF containers, all rejected with `no BMHD`. Its automatic
discovery now covers only the tested `.IFF` / `.LBM` picture families;
explicit other inputs still report their parser errors. The library
directory scan additionally checks top-level `BB.DAT`, which round-trips
identically along with the 21 `.LIB` files.

Verification after adoption: all four directory commands in
`tools/README.md` exit zero: TPWM 489 files, PAL 33, IFF 66, LIB 22;
each reports zero failures. The TPWM packer comparison reports `isle 5`,
`moon 421`, and `moon but the last item 63`; the last category is not a
complete recompression match despite an identical parsed-item round trip.
The three single-file PNG commands for `00.PAL`, `AHHIMMEL.LBM`, and
`INTRO/CHR14.LIB` also exit zero, the library using its new default
palette without `--pal`. Logs are `build/file-tools-probe/adopted-*.log`.
No visual or original-runtime comparisons were made.

Four additional experimental inspectors are now present:
`datfiles.py`, `mapfiles.py`, `txtfiles.py`, and `sndfiles.py`. Their probe
results and limits are listed above. The DAT, map and text tools adapt
offline parsing techniques; the sound tool is project-specific. These are
not port parsers, and none has been checked against History Line's original
loading routines. `tools/test_file_formats.py` uses synthetic data only.
